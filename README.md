# Forecasting-Food-Prices
Writing functions in R to analyze and predict food price time series data

Citation: This project is downloaded from the Project ["Functions for Food Price Forecasts"](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/515) on DataCamp. The markdown, background information, and images currently in the notebook, as well as the data, are from DataCamp. The code is my solution to the project.  

Over time, I will expand on this project with my own additional code, more functions, and more analysis, but for now this repo is meant to share an example of my R coding abilities.
